# Deployment entry point for PaaS hosts that only support a root Dockerfile
# built from the repository (CranL, and others with the same constraint).
#
# It deliberately does NOT build the monorepo. The Nuxt production build peaks
# above 4 GB and is OOM-killed on a small app plan, so the image is built by
# .github/workflows/publish-image.yml on a GitHub runner and merely pulled here.
#
# Consequences of that split, in order of how likely they are to bite:
#
#   1. Pushing code does not change what is deployed. Run the publish workflow
#      first, then redeploy. A tag pinned below makes that explicit; `latest`
#      quietly deploys whatever was published last.
#   2. This is the `prod-lite` variant: no embedded Postgres or Redis. The host
#      must provide both, plus S3 for uploads — hosts without a persistent
#      volume lose container-local data on every redeploy.
#   3. The image serves on port 80 behind its bundled Caddy, not 3000.
#
# See docs/DEPLOY_CRANL.md for the full deployment procedure.
