# Deployment entry point for PaaS hosts that only support a root Dockerfile
# built from the repository (CranL, and others with the same constraint).
#
# It deliberately does NOT build the monorepo. The Nuxt production build peaks
# above 4 GB and is OOM-killed on a small app plan, so the image is built by
# .github/workflows/publish-image.yml on a GitHub runner and merely pulled here.
#
# Consequences of that split, in order of how likely they are to bite:
#
#   1. Pushing code does not change what is deployed. Run the publish workflow
#      first, then redeploy. A tag pinned below makes that explicit; `latest`
#      quietly deploys whatever was published last.
#   2. This is the `prod-lite` variant: no embedded Postgres or Redis. The host
#      must provide both, plus S3 for uploads — hosts without a persistent
#      volume lose container-local data on every redeploy.
#   3. The image serves on port 80 behind its bundled Caddy, not 3000.
#
# See docs/DEPLOY_CRANL.md for the full deployment procedure.

# Published 2026-08-15 by publish-image.yml from tag v2.7.0 @ 889c97dcf, digest
# sha256:4de218645668d6ae6252c7d5dfe30f02d71f2efe82105c837a8dbc197328a7ec
#
# **No migrations.** `makemigrations --check` is clean against this tree, and
# 2.7.0 adds no model fields, so the schema is identical to 2.6.1's and this
# rolls forward — and back — without touching the database.
#
# 2.7.0 is a pre-launch audit pass. The two that matter most in production:
#
#   - A public dashboard link returned every column of its backing table, not
#     just the ones its widgets display. Anyone holding a share URL could read
#     the rest of the row. Existing links keep working and are now scoped.
#   - Backup retention listed by prefix and deleted anything past the window,
#     so an empty JADAWEL_BACKUP_S3_PREFIX meant the whole bucket. The config
#     now refuses an empty prefix, which means a backup job configured that way
#     will fail loudly on this image instead of running.
#
# Also: rate limits are countable per client (they keyed on a caller-controlled
# header before, so the contact form was an open mail relay), disabled MCP tools
# can no longer be invoked by name, share tokens expire, chart and agenda
# widgets read date columns correctly, and user files are archived alongside the
# database dump.
#
# Set JADAWEL_* in the dashboard before deploying. The BASEROW_* shims still
# accept the old names, but JADAWEL_JWT_SIGNING_KEY must carry the same value
# as BASEROW_JWT_SIGNING_KEY or every issued session is invalidated.
#
# JADAWEL_ENABLE_SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER=yes is worth setting here: it is what
# turns on Secure cookies and HSTS, and the all-in-one image defaults it empty.
#
# Pinned by digest, not by tag. The publish workflow pushes `:latest` alongside
# the version tag, so a tag pin does not identify a fixed image. The digest
# does, and it is the 2.7.0 build described above.
